> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
  Analysis:
  Looking through the conversation chronologically:

  1. Initial continuation - The user indicated this session was being continued from a previous conversation with summarized context. The context showed a qBittorrent TUI had been built following PLAN.md
  with all 5 phases completed and multiple issues fixed.

  2. The user reported three feature requests for expansion:
     - Responsive layout to use full terminal width
     - Torrent sorting capability
     - Configurable columns

  3. I created FEATURES.md to plan these features, which the user approved with "OK - small thing before we keep going..."

  4. The user then requested keeping upload/download speed columns adjacent (minor UX improvement)

  5. The user noticed the filter panel only showed 3 options at a time and requested it be responsive (up to 6 based on width)

  6. After completing responsive layout, the user said "OK, this is all looking great. Shall we move onto the next feature I asked you about?"

  7. I started implementing torrent sorting, and the user said "Hit it." to proceed

  8. After completing sorting, the user said "OK, on to the next! It looks like you are going to need to compact soon as well"

  9. I began implementing configurable columns but the conversation was interrupted for this summary

  Key patterns:
  - The user gave clear, concise feedback and requests
  - They approved each feature before moving to the next
  - They provided specific UX feedback (column ordering, filter options)
  - They noted the context was getting full

  Summary:
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     - Continue development of qBittorrent TUI from previous session
     - Implement three major features:
       1. Responsive layout - Terminal width utilization (expand columns to use available space)
       2. Torrent sorting - Sort by any column with keyboard shortcuts
       3. Configurable columns - Show/hide columns, add new data fields
     - Specific UX improvements:
       - Keep upload/download speed columns adjacent to each other
       - Make filter selection responsive (show 3-6 options based on terminal width)

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - Bubble Tea TUI framework (bubbletea/bubbles)
     - Responsive column sizing with flex-grow algorithm
     - Dynamic filter panel option visibility
     - Sort algorithms with multi-column support
     - Go interfaces and struct composition
     - Column priority system for narrow terminals
     - Sort direction indicators in headers

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `/home/nick/nickvanw/qbitorrent-tui/FEATURES.md` (created)
        - Planning document for new features
        - Detailed implementation plans for responsive layout, sorting, and configurable columns
        ```markdown
        ### 1. Responsive Layout - Full Terminal Width Usage
        **Priority: High** | **Effort: Medium** | **Impact: High**
        ```

     - `/home/nick/nickvanw/qbitorrent-tui/internal/ui/components/torrent_list.go`
        - Core component for displaying torrents
        - Implemented responsive columns, sorting logic
        ```go
        // ColumnConfig represents a responsive table column
        type ColumnConfig struct {
            Key      string  // Unique identifier for the column
            Title    string  // Display title
            MinWidth int     // Minimum column width
            MaxWidth int     // Maximum column width (0 = unlimited)
            FlexGrow float64 // How much this column should grow (0-1)
            Priority int     // Hide order on narrow screens (1=highest priority)
        }

        // SortConfig represents the current sort configuration
        type SortConfig struct {
            Column    string    // Column key to sort by
            Direction SortDir   // Sort direction
            Secondary string    // Secondary sort column (for ties)
        }
        ```

     - `/home/nick/nickvanw/qbitorrent-tui/internal/ui/components/filter_panel.go`
        - Filter panel component
        - Made filter options responsive (3-6 visible based on width)
        ```go
        // calculateMaxVisibleOptions determines how many filter options to show based on terminal width
        func (f *FilterPanel) calculateMaxVisibleOptions() int {
            if f.width < 120 {
                return minVisible  // 3 options on narrow screens
            } else if f.width < 160 {
                return 4  // 4 options on medium screens
            } else if f.width < 200 {
                return 5  // 5 options on wide screens
            } else {
                return maxVisible  // 6 options on very wide screens
            }
        }
        ```

     - Test files created/updated:
        - `torrent_list_test.go` - Added responsive layout and sorting tests
        - `filter_panel_test.go` - Added responsive filter option tests

  4. Errors and fixes:
     - **Unused import error**:
        - Added `"time"` import but didn't use it
        - Fixed by removing the unused import
     - **Missing imports in tests**:
        - Tests referenced `api` and `strings` packages without importing
        - Fixed by adding proper imports
     - **Test module path issues**:
        - Tried to create standalone test file with relative imports
        - Fixed by removing test file and adding tests to existing test files

  5. Problem Solving:
     - Responsive column algorithm: Used flex-grow pattern similar to CSS flexbox
     - Column ordering: Reordered default columns per user request (down/up adjacent)
     - Filter panel responsiveness: Simple width-based breakpoints for option count
     - Sorting implementation: Used Go's sort.Slice with custom comparator
     - Visual sort indicators: Added ↑/↓ arrows to column headers

  6. All user messages:
     - "OK - small thing before we keep going. can we keep the upload and download speed columns next to eachother, instead of having the peer count between them?"
     - "Thanks - can we also make the filtering selection at the bottom responsive? If we have more width, it doesn't look like it uses it."
     - "It still only shows three things to filter on at a time - seems like that could be more? Maybe we have a maximum of six depending on the width of the window?"
     - "OK, this is all looking great. Shall we move onto the next feature I asked you about?"
     - "Hit it."
     - "OK, on to the next! It looks like you are going to need to compact soon as well"

  7. Pending Tasks:
     - Complete configurable columns implementation (in progress)
     - Consider adding UI component tests for better coverage
     - Consider adding linting to CI (golangci-lint)

  8. Current Work:
     Started implementing configurable columns feature by modifying torrent_list.go to support all available columns:
     ```go
     // All available column definitions
     var allColumns = []ColumnConfig{
         {Key: "name", Title: "Name", MinWidth: 20, MaxWidth: 0, FlexGrow: 0.4, Priority: 1},
         {Key: "size", Title: "Size", MinWidth: 8, MaxWidth: 12, FlexGrow: 0.0, Priority: 3},
         // ... existing columns ...
         {Key: "eta", Title: "ETA", MinWidth: 8, MaxWidth: 12, FlexGrow: 0.0, Priority: 6},
         {Key: "added_on", Title: "Added", MinWidth: 10, MaxWidth: 16, FlexGrow: 0.0, Priority: 7},
         {Key: "category", Title: "Category", MinWidth: 8, MaxWidth: 15, FlexGrow: 0.0, Priority: 8},
         {Key: "tags", Title: "Tags", MinWidth: 8, MaxWidth: 20, FlexGrow: 0.0, Priority: 9},
         {Key: "tracker", Title: "Tracker", MinWidth: 10, MaxWidth: 20, FlexGrow: 0.0, Priority: 10},
     }
     ```

  9. Optional Next Step:
     Continue implementing configurable columns feature by:
     1. Adding visible columns tracking to TorrentList struct
     2. Implementing column toggle functionality
     3. Adding 'C' key handler for column configuration UI
     4. Updating renderTorrent to handle new column types

     This directly continues the work started in response to the user's request: "OK, on to the next!" referring to the configurable columns feature from FEATURES.md..
  Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
